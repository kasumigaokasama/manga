{"session_id":"dd7fcf13-0c8c-49a9-b7de-5de589b4ef09","ts":1757846358,"text":" Project Overview\nPADERCLEAN is a professional car detailing service (interior-focused vehicle cleaning) based in Paderborn, Germany. We need a modern, responsive web application for PADERCLEAN, implemented as an Angular 20 single-page application (SPA) with multiple views (Home, About, Services, References, Contact, etc.), and a Node.js/Express backend for handling form submissions (email sending) and security logic. The site should reflect PADERCLEAN’s corporate identity (colors, logo) and meet high standards of design, performance, security, and SEO.\n\n Key Requirements and Features\n\nFramework & Technology:\n\nUse Angular v20 (TypeScript) for the front-end SPA, following the latest best practices (standalone components, OnPush change detection, Angular Signals for state, etc.).\n\nUse Node.js + Express for the backend (to handle the contact form email and any server-side needs).\n\nEnsure the app is built with modern Angular features and clean architecture (e.g., use Angular CLI for project setup, Angular Routing for multiple pages, lazy-loaded routes for performance, etc.).\n\nDesign & Front-End:\n\nResponsive Multi-Page Layout: Implement a multi-page feel with Angular routing (pages: Home, Über Uns (About), Leistungen (Services), Referenzen (References), Kontakt (Contact), plus legal pages Impressum, Datenschutz, AGB). Each page should be a separate view/component.\n\nCorporate Identity: Apply PADERCLEAN’s branding – use the new car silhouette logo across the site (e.g., in the header, hero section). The logo in the header should be clickable and link back to the home page.\n\nColor Scheme: Use the specified brand colors: Primary Dark #0c1d36, Primary Blue #3a6ea5, Light Blue #d6e8f0, White #ffffff, Text Dark #333333, Text Light #666666 for backgrounds, accents, text, etc. Define these in CSS (consider using CSS custom properties for maintainability).\n\nTypography: Use modern, clean fonts – e.g. Montserrat or Poppins for headlines and Nunito or Roboto for body text. Include these via Google Fonts. Ensure headings and body text have appropriate font-weights (headlines semi-bold/bold, body light/regular as given).\n\nLayout & Styling: Use HTML5 semantic elements and CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid) to create a clean, accessible layout. Implement a mobile-first design that looks good on mobile (smartphones) and scales up to tablets and desktops. The site should be tested in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, iOS/Android browsers).\n\nImages & Icons: Integrate Font Awesome 6.4.0 for icons (e.g., service icons, social icons). Use NgOptimizedImage for optimizing images in Angular (for any static images like logos or gallery photos) to improve loading performance\nangular.dev\nangular.dev\n. Provide a favicon and a full set of PWA/manifest icons (so the site can be added to home screen).\n\nAnimations: Add subtle, polished animations for better UX – for example, fade-in sections on scroll, hover effects on buttons, or an interactive before/after image slider. Use Angular’s built-in animation capabilities or CSS transitions. Keep animations lightweight and performance-friendly.\n\nCookie Consent Banner: Implement a GDPR-compliant cookie consent banner. On first visit, it should inform users about cookie usage (e.g., for analytics) and allow them to accept or adjust settings. Once accepted, the choice should be saved (e.g., in localStorage or a cookie) so that the banner does not show again unnecessarily\nanswers.netlify.com\n. The banner should appear on all pages until consent is given, and users should be able to reopen/adjust their cookie settings (link in footer).\n\nBackend & Functionality:\n\nContact Form Backend: Set up an Express.js server (Node.js) to handle form submissions from the Contact page. When a user submits the contact form, the backend should:\n\nValidate the input (to prevent spam/abuse).\n\nVerify the reCAPTCHA v3 token with Google’s API.\n\nSend an email with the inquiry details to the business owner’s email (and optionally send a confirmation to the user) using Nodemailer. Use the provided Strato SMTP settings (host smtp.strato.de, port 465, SSL, auth user infopaderclean.de, pass from env) for sending emails. (These credentials should be configurable via environment variables, not hard-coded, for security.)\nangular.dev\n\nRespond with a success or error message that the Angular app can display to the user.\n\nExpress Server Security: Harden the Node.js backend with security middleware: use Helmet for secure headers, enable CORS only for the front-end’s domain, apply rate limiting (e.g., max 5 form submissions per 15 minutes per IP) to prevent abuse\nangular.dev\n, and ensure any user input is sanitized (to prevent injection attacks in email or logs). Also implement CSRF protection if the form is served on the same domain (or ensure that the REST endpoint is protected against CSRF by design/token).\n\nNo Server-Side Rendering (optional): The Angular app can be a client-side rendered SPA. However, for SEO purposes you might consider using Angular Universal for SSR or prerendering. If not using SSR, ensure the dynamic meta tags are handled on the client. (This is optional since search engines can crawl SPAs, but SSR would improve initial load and SEO.)\n\nSecurity Features (Front-end):\n\nUse Angular’s built-in XSS protection (Angular auto-sanitizes interpolations) – avoid directly inserting any untrusted HTML.\n\nEnsure forms use Angular’s form validation and possibly additional HTML5 validation attributes. Display friendly validation errors to the user for required fields or bad input.\n\nIntegrate Google reCAPTCHA v3 on the frontend: include the reCAPTCHA script, obtain a token on form submit, and send it to the backend for verification. (No UI challenge is shown to the user, but you must check the score on the server and decide if the submission seems legitimate.)\n\nHTTPS: The site will be served over HTTPS (Strato hosting + SSL certificate). Enforce HTTPS links for any resources. If any mixed content or external scripts (like Google Maps, fonts, etc.), ensure they load over https.\n\nSEO Optimization:\n\nSet appropriate Meta Tags (title, description, keywords) for each page. Use Angular’s Meta and Title services to update these on route change (for SPA without SSR).\n\nInclude Open Graph and Twitter Card tags in the HTML <head> for social sharing (e.g., title, description, image (perhaps a nice image of a clean car or PADERCLEAN logo)).\n\nAdd structured data (Schema.org JSON-LD) for local business and relevant services. For example, include organization markup with name, address, phone, opening hours, etc., and perhaps use schema for “Auto detailing service”\n\n.Provide an XML Sitemap (sitemap.xml) covering all important URLs, and a robots.txt file that permits crawling. (These can be static files placed in the deployment, not necessarily generated by Angular.)\n\nUse breadcrumb navigation on applicable pages (and mark it up with Schema.org if possible) – for example, on subpages show “Home > Services > …”\n\n.Target local SEO keywords like “Fahrzeugaufbereitung Paderborn” in headings or content where appropriate (without overstuffing), since the business is local.\n\nPerformance Optimization:\n\nBundling & Minification: Use Angular’s production build which will bundle and minify JS/CSS. Ensure any additional scripts or styles are also minified.\n\nCompression: Enable GZIP or Brotli compression on the server for text assets (HTML, JS, CSS) to improve load times.\n\nCaching: Set far-future cache headers for static assets (with proper file hashing via Angular CLI) so that repeat visits are faster. The HTML (or main index) can have a shorter cache.\n\nImage Optimization: Use optimized images (compressed JPEGs/PNGs, or WebP format) and responsive image sizes. Possibly use <img ngOptimizedImage> for automatic optimizations\nangular.dev\n. Implement lazy loading for offscreen images (Angular’s default loading=\"lazy\" on images or manual intersection observer if needed).\n\nFast Loading: Aim for a Google PageSpeed Insights score of 90+ by eliminating render-blocking resources (Angular will inline critical CSS by default), minimizing third-party scripts, and keeping the bundle size lean.\n\nPWA & HTTP/2: Leverage HTTP/2 by serving assets over it (most modern hosts do this automatically with HTTPS). Set up the app as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using Angular’s PWA support (ng add angular/pwa) so that it can cache assets and even work offline. Include a web app manifest with the provided icons and name.\n\n Pages & Content Structure\n\nDesign each page/component with relevant content and elements:\n\n Startseite (Home) – Overview of the service and call-to-action:\n\nA hero section featuring the PADERCLEAN logo (car silhouette) and a tagline. This should immediately convey the service (“Professionelle Fahrzeugaufbereitung in Paderborn”) and perhaps a call-to-action button (“Termin vereinbaren” or \"Jetzt Termin anfragen\").\n\nA brief overview of services offered, possibly in a few cards or icons (e.g., Interior Cleaning, Leather Care, Odor Removal, etc.) with short descriptions.\n\nA section highlighting pricing/packages: e.g., a comparison of 2-3 service packages with names (like “Standard”, “Premium” interior cleaning packages) and prices starting from a certain amount. Note: increase the base prices by about 10 from previous listings, and label them as “ab XX ” (meaning “starting at”). For example, if “Standard Paket – ab 60”. Include a footnote under the pricing table (denoted by an asterisk) explaining: “*Preise beziehen sich auf Kleinwagen (kleinste Fahrzeugklasse); größe Fahrzeuge oder hoher Verschmutzungsgrad können Aufpreise verursachen.” (Translation: \"Prices shown are for small cars; larger vehicles or heavy soiling may cost extra.\"). This informs customers that final pricing may vary.\n\nA short “About us” teaser: a few sentences about the owner’s passion for car cleaning, with a link/button to read more on the About page.\n\nA gallery of a few before-and-after photos showcasing the cleaning results (could be an interactive slider for each photo, or a simple grid gallery with labels “Vorher/Nachher”). This gives visual proof of quality.\n\nA contact teaser: highlight how to get in touch, e.g., “Interesse geweckt? Jetzt Termin anfragen!” with a button linking to the Contact page, plus a phone number for quick contact.\n\nEnsure the home page is visually engaging and concise, with clear navigation to other sections.\n\n Über Uns (About Us) – The story and mission:\n\nContent detailing Taner Isik’s personal story and passion for car cleaning. Explain how PADERCLEAN started: from cleaning family and friends’ cars as a hobby to turning it into a professional business. Emphasize the love for detail, quality, and customer satisfaction. (Use the provided narrative text about the founder’s background and philosophy in this section – it discusses how a clean car brings joy and improves quality of life, etc. You can break it into a couple of paragraphs for readability.)\n\nPossibly include a photo of the founder or the team, to add a personal touch (if available).\n\nThe mission statement: e.g., “Wir sorgen dafür, dass Sie Ihr Fahrzeug wieder rundum genießen können – mit Liebe zum Detail und so, als wäre es unser eigenes.” (This and similar lines from the provided text can be used to emphasize quality and care.)\n\nKeep the about page personal and authentic, building trust with potential customers.\n\n️ Leistungen (Services) – Detailed services offered:\n\nA list of all services and packages PADERCLEAN offers for vehicle detailing. For each service, provide a title, description, and an image or icon. Services might include, for example: Innenraumreinigung (interior cleaning), Polster- und Teppichreinigung (upholstery and carpet cleaning), Lederpflege (leather care), Tierhaarentfernung (pet hair removal), Scheibenreinigung (window cleaning), Geruchsneutralisierung (odor neutralization, possibly via ozone – if ozone treatment was “coming soon,” either mark it as coming soon or omit if not offered yet).\n\nEnsure an icon or image is present for each service (for Scheibenreinigung (window cleaning), include an appropriate icon, since it was noted one was missing). You can use Font Awesome icons (e.g., a windshield icon) or relevant images.\n\nFor each service, describe what’s included and if applicable, a starting price or price range. (E.g., “Tierhaarentfernung – gründliche Entfernung von Tierhaaren aus Polstern und Teppich, Preis nach Aufwand ab 20 Aufpreis.”) Keep emphasis that final pricing depends on vehicle size/condition — no fixed prices without seeing the vehicle.\n\nPossibly include an interactive element: e.g., an accordion or tabs for “Our 5-Step Process” describing the workflow (inspection, vacuuming, deep cleaning, special treatments, final polish, etc.). This educates the client on how thorough the service is.\n\nThe layout could be sections or cards for each service, with images that open in a lightbox when clicked for a larger view.\n\nMake sure the content is real (replace any placeholder or sample text from the template with actual service descriptions and data). Remove any “coming soon” items if they’re not relevant (e.g., if ozone treatment is not actually available yet, it might be better to omit until it’s ready, as per the note).\n\nConclude the services page with a call-to-action or a note: e.g., “Nicht sicher, welches Paket das richtige ist? Kontaktieren Sie uns – wir beraten Sie gern und erstellen ein individuelles Angebot.” (Offer to help choose services or provide custom quote.)\n\n⭐ Referenzen (References/Testimonials) – Social proof and results:\n\nStart with some key stats to build credibility: e.g., “Bereits 500+ Fahrzeuge gereinigt” and an average rating like “Durchschnittliche Bewertung: 4,9/5 Sterne”. Use eye-catching figures (if these numbers are provided or can be estimated).\n\nInclude an interactive before-and-after slider component. For example, a photo with a draggable slider that reveals the before state on one side and after on the other. This can be implemented with a JavaScript library or custom CSS/TS in Angular. Show at least a couple of such comparisons if possible.\n\nA gallery of project images with filters: e.g., allow filtering by type of vehicle or service (car, van, severe dirt, etc.), so users can see examples relevant to their needs. If implementing filters is complex, a simple grid gallery categorized by captions could suffice.\n\nCustomer testimonials/reviews: Display several customer feedback quotes (if available). Each testimonial can include the customer’s first name and maybe date (avoid full names for privacy). Optionally, a star rating graphic for each.\n\nA ratings breakdown chart: e.g., a horizontal bar chart or list showing how many 5★, 4★, etc., reviews there are (especially if most are 5★, to impress visitors). This could be a static representation if data is static.\n\nEnsure this page remains fast – if many images, use lazy loading. The interactive elements (slider, filters) should be smooth and mobile-friendly.\n\nThis page builds trust, so make it visually appealing and not too text-heavy. Use modals or lightboxes for images to keep the page clean.\n\n Kontakt (Contact) – Get in touch & FAQs:\n\nA contact form for users to request an appointment or ask questions. Form fields should include: Name, E-Mail, Telefonnummer (phone, optional perhaps), and Nachricht. Do not include date/time pickers for desired appointment (as per request to remove “Wunschtermin und Uhrzeit” fields). Instead, instruct users (e.g., in the placeholder or a note) to mention their preferred date/time in the message text. For example, placeholder in message could be “Ihre Nachricht (gern mit Wunschtermin oder Zeitfenster)”\n\n.The submit button should read “Jetzt Termin anfragen” (instead of “Nachricht senden”). When clicked, it will trigger Angular form validation, then (if valid) execute the reCAPTCHA v3 check and send the data to the backend API. Provide user feedback: show a success alert/message if sent successfully (“Danke für Ihre Anfrage! Wir melden uns in Kürze.”), or an error message if something goes wrong (“Fehler: Ihre Nachricht konnte nicht gesendet werden. Bitte versuchen Sie es später erneut.”).\n\nContact Details: Below or alongside the form, list other contact information:\n\nPhone number (tel link so mobile users can tap to call).\n\nEmail address (mailto link).\n\nPhysical address of the business.\n\nOperating hours/days.\n\nA WhatsApp contact link or number, with a note like “Schicken Sie uns gerne Bilder Ihres Fahrzeugs über WhatsApp für eine genaue Preisabschätzung.” (Encourage sending photos via WhatsApp for price estimates since no fixed prices).\n\nMap Integration: Embed a Google Maps frame showing the location of the business (Paderborn). Ensure it’s responsive (Google Maps embed is an <iframe> – you might wrap it in a div with a responsive aspect ratio or use CSS to make it fluid).\n\nFAQ Section: Include a few frequently asked questions to address common concerns. For example:\n\n“Wie kann ich bezahlen?”– Answer: explain accepted payment methods (e.g., “Sie können bar bei Abholung bezahlen oder per Überweisung nach Rechnung. Kartenzahlung ist derzeit nicht möglich.”– meaning cash or bank transfer, no card payments, as specified in the notes).\n\n“Bieten Sie auch Außenreinigung an?”– If not, say that currently the focus is on interior (or whatever is appropriate).\n\n“Wie lange dauert eine Innenreinigung?”– Provide an average timeframe.\n\netc.\nKeep the FAQ answers concise. This section can use an accordion style (so users can expand questions to see answers).\n\nEnsure all contact page elements are accessible on mobile (form fields easy to tap, etc.), and that form submission is secure (we already covered reCAPTCHA and validation).\n\n Impressum/Datenschutz/AGB – Legal pages (footer links):\n\nIn the footer of the site (visible on all pages), include links to Impressum (Legal Notice), Datenschutz (Privacy Policy), and AGB (Terms and Conditions). These are required by law in Germany.\n\nCreate simple separate pages or modals for these. They can be plain text pages styled consistently with the site. The content is mostly text:\n\nImpressum: will have the business owner’s details, address, contact, and regulatory info (as per German requirements).\n\nDatenschutz: will outline the privacy policy (how user data, cookies, etc., are handled).\n\nAGB (Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen): the terms of service. (Use the provided AGB draft text for this page). You can format it with sections as in the draft (Geltungsbereich, Leistungsumfang, Vertragsschluss, Preise/Zahlung, Stornierung, Haftung, etc.). This is long text, so ensure the page has proper headings or list formatting for each section for readability.\n\nThese pages don’t require dynamic functionality, but make sure they are accessible and included in the Angular routing (or at least reachable via static links). If they are static (could also just be static HTML served outside Angular), you can decide whether to integrate them into the Angular app or not. It might be simplest to include them as additional routes/components in Angular for a seamless SPA experience.\n\n⚙️ Development Notes (Angular Specific)\n\nWhen instructing Codex, encourage adherence to modern Angular best practices and project structure:\n\nProject Setup: Use Angular CLI to scaffold the application (e.g., ng new paderclean-site --routing --style=scss). Organize the app into feature modules or standalone components for each page. Given Angular 20 defaults to standalone components, you can make each page a standalone component and configure routes accordingly. Use the Angular Router to define paths for each page (`'', 'ueber-uns', 'leistungen', 'referenzen', 'kontakt', etc.). Implement lazy loading for feature modules if using modular structure (e.g., load the References page module only when that route is visited, as it might have heavy content like images).\n\nComponents & Structure: Create reusable components where appropriate (for example, a component for the pricing table, a component for the testimonial slider, etc.) to keep code modular. Follow Angular’s style guide for file naming and component conventions (Angular 20 no longer appends suffixes by default, but ensure clarity in naming).\n\nState Management: The site is mostly static content, so extensive state management may not be needed. But for interactive parts (like the gallery filter or showing/hiding the cookie banner), use Angular’s reactivity. Angular v16+ introduced Signals; you can use signals for local component state where it makes sense (for simpler, fine-grained reactivity), or use RxJS Observables/Subjects for more complex scenarios. Keep the use of any state management simple.\n\nForms: Implement the contact form using Reactive Forms (FormGroup and FormControl in Angular) for robust validation. This allows adding validators (required, email format, etc.) and checking form status easily. Display form errors beneath fields as needed. On submit, gather the form values and send via Angular’s HttpClient to the backend API endpoint (e.g., a POST to /api/contact).\n\nHTTP Client: Use Angular’s HttpClient module to communicate with the backend. Configure the base URL in an environment file (for development vs production). Handle responses and errors in the code (show user a success or error message accordingly). Possibly use a loading indicator while the request is in progress.\n\nRouting & Navigation: Use the Angular Router <router-outlet> in the main AppComponent template to swap pages. Provide a navigation menu (likely a header with links) so users can navigate. The header/nav should highlight the current page. Ensure that navigating via the URL also works (deep linking to subpages). Also implement a scroll-to-top on route change (so when navigation occurs, the view starts at top of page).\n\nGlobal Styles: Utilize styles.scss (or global styles) for things like the font imports, CSS variables for colors, and perhaps some resets or global classes (like container widths). Use component-specific styles for page-specific styling to keep things encapsulated.\n\nIcon Integration: Import FontAwesome icons either by including the CDN link in index.html or by using an Angular package for FA. If using a few icons, CDN might be simplest. Ensure icons are properly placed (e.g., icons for phone, email on contact page, social media icons in footer, service icons on services page, star icons for ratings, etc.).\n\nCookie Banner Implementation: You can create an Angular service to manage cookie consent state and an Angular component for the banner. On init, the component checks localStorage (or cookies) for a consent flag. If not present, it displays the banner (with options to Accept or Manage). On accept, store the user’s consent choice and hide the banner. (Since we’re not actually integrating a real analytics in this prompt, this can be a functional stub – just ensure the code structure is there to potentially handle toggling analytics scripts based on consent).\n\nTesting: Although Codex might not write tests unless prompted, you should mention quality checks. Ensure to test the site on different screen sizes and browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Android, iOS) for responsiveness. Also verify all interactive elements: the contact form (try submitting with missing info to see validation, with correct info to see success, etc.), the image sliders, the map loading, etc. No console errors should remain (e.g., the earlier Uncaught Error at script.js:91 from the old code should not occur in the new Angular app).\n\nDeployment Configuration: The Angular app will likely be deployed on Strato as static files. The Node/Express API might be deployed on a separate server (VPS or cloud service). Keep that in mind for CORS – e.g., if the frontend is served at paderclean.de and backend at api.paderclean.de or a different port, configure CORS accordingly. Provide instructions or configuration for building and deploying (in README or comments), e.g., how to run ng build and then upload files to Strato, and to start the Node server with proper environment variables.\n\n Additional Quality and Compliance\n\nAccessibility: Ensure the site meets WCAG 2.1 guidelines – use proper HTML landmarks (header, nav, main, footer), alt attributes for images (describe images like “Vorher-Nachher Bild Innenraum vorher” etc.), and sufficient color contrast (the provided colors should be checked for contrast against backgrounds). Make forms accessible with labels and ARIA attributes for error messages as needed. Users should be able to navigate via keyboard (e.g., the menu, form inputs).\n\nGDPR Compliance: The privacy policy page should detail data handling. The cookie banner and not loading analytics without consent is part of compliance. Also, if any user data is stored (e.g., contact form submissions), ensure compliance (likely they are just emailed and not stored long-term).\n\nLegal: The Impressum must have the owner’s name, address, contact email/phone, and tax ID or similar if applicable (to comply with German law). The AGB page text should be included as given (or summarized if needed).\n\nQuality Assurance: Validate the HTML (no critical W3C validation errors). The site should appear professional and “complete”– no filler text, no missing images or broken links. It should reflect a high-quality production-ready website."}

Angefangen hat alles ganz privat: Ich habe zunächst die Fahrzeuge von Familie, Freunden und natürlich mein eigenes Auto gereinigt. Dabei habe ich schnell gemerkt, wie viel Freude es mir bereitet, wenn ein Fahrzeug nach der Reinigung wieder wie neu wirkt – frisch riecht, glänzt und seinen Besitzern ein gutes Gefühl gibt.\n\nMit der Zeit habe ich meine Techniken perfektioniert und mich dazu entschieden, aus meinem Hobby mehr zu machen. So ist PADERCLEAN entstanden – mit dem Ziel, anderen Menschen das gleiche Gefühl von Freude und Zufriedenheit zu schenken.\n\nDenn ich bin überzeugt: Ein sauberes Auto ist mehr als nur ein optischer Luxus. Es macht den Alltag angenehmer, sorgt für Wohlbefinden und unterstreicht die eigene Lebensqualität.\nMit Liebe zum Detail, Leidenschaft und dem Anspruch, jedes Auto so zu behandeln, als wäre es mein eigenes, sorge ich dafür, dass Sie Ihr Fahrzeug wieder rundum genießen können.\nBild\nBild\nEntwurf – Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen (AGB) für PADERCLEAN\n\nGeltungsbereich\n\nDiese Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen (AGB) gelten für alle Verträge zwischen PADERCLEAN – Fahrzeuginnenreinigung, Inh.

Angefangen hat alles ganz privat: Ich habe zunächst die Fahrzeuge von Familie, Freunden und natürlich mein eigenes Auto gereinigt. Dabei habe ich schnell gemerkt, wie viel Freude es mir bereitet, wenn ein Fahrzeug nach der Reinigung wieder wie neu wirkt – frisch riecht, glänzt und seinen Besitzern ein gutes Gefühl gibt.\n\nMit der Zeit habe ich meine Techniken perfektioniert und mich dazu entschieden, aus meinem Hobby mehr zu machen. So ist PADERCLEAN entstanden – mit dem Ziel, anderen Menschen das gleiche Gefühl von Freude und Zufriedenheit zu schenken.\n\nDenn ich bin überzeugt: Ein sauberes Auto ist mehr als nur ein optischer Luxus. Es macht den Alltag angenehmer, sorgt für Wohlbefinden und unterstreicht die eigene Lebensqualität.\nMit Liebe zum Detail, Leidenschaft und dem Anspruch, jedes Auto so zu behandeln, als wäre es mein eigenes, sorge ich dafür, dass Sie Ihr Fahrzeug wieder rundum genießen können."}
